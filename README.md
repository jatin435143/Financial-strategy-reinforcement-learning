## Overview

This project develops a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model that dynamically adapts trading strategies based on prevailing market conditions. The model continuously switches between different technical indicator-based strategies, leveraging their specific strengths to optimize trading decisions in changing market environments.

---

## Key Features

- Developed a custom DRL trading environment with reward-driven exploration and Q-value updates to learn optimal trading policies.  
- Designed the model to adapt to market dynamics by switching strategies according to real-time market conditions, enhancing decision accuracy.  
- Achieved a return of ₹1705 on an initial investment of ₹2500 over 520 trading days, significantly outperforming benchmark DRL algorithms: PPO (₹864) and DQN (₹1645).  
- Integrated reinforcement learning techniques with financial modeling and algorithmic trading strategies for practical, real-world application.

## Technical Highlights

- Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms used for benchmarking.  
- Reward functions designed to capture profitability and risk-adjusted returns.  
- Realistic trading simulation environment capturing market volatility and technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Averages.  
- Continuous strategy switching mechanism enabling the model to exploit different indicators’ advantages in varying market regimes.
